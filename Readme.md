This a docker image based in the [official Postgres 14.1-alpine docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) tweaked for database testing.

It basically configure things like turning off write ahead log (`fsync=off`) to make it faster. Notice that this can make the database more likely to be in an inconsistent state, if the case of a server crash. This is not a problem for database testing as we are more concerned with fast feedback and not about loosing data.

This is an alternative to [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), [in memory SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) and [HyperSQL](http://hsqldb.org/). You should consider this as it runs a real PostgreSQL server, that would be very close on what you have in production.

Check the file `config.sh` for all the configurations.

## Tips for writing tests

- Do all schema setup (DDL) once before running the tests
- Run the schema setup (DDL), as the DB migration that would run in production
- Avoid DDL in each test, as that tent to be very slow
- Before each test, truncate the tables and put some seed data (DML), that should be quick
- Remember fasts tests are important, slow tests make you avoid refactoring code!

## TODO

- Tweak `shared_buffers`
- Tweak `work_mem`
